# Database (PostgreSQL)

Everything this project does with PostgreSQL, in one page.

## Connection

One variable: `DATABASE_URL`. Development has a working default built in.
`.env.dev` ships with the development values and overrides it, and a personal
root `.env` overrides that.

```
postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/template-db?sslmode=disable
```

The database is named **`template-db`** (it was `rust_template` before the
Spring migration, so an existing `.env` / `.env.example` needs updating). The
hyphen is legal in a Postgres name but SQL has to quote it, e.g. `DROP DATABASE
"template-db"`.

- `manage.sh` (reset-database, backend startup check) reads `.env` first, then
  `.env.dev`. `set-role` is the exception: it reads `DATABASE_URL` from the
  environment and deliberately ignores the `.env` files.
- Changing host/port/db means changing only this URL — no code changes. Under
  `docker compose` the API connects to `db:5432` instead of `localhost`.

## Setting up a local instance (macOS)

**Option 1 — Homebrew service (recommended): survives reboots**

```bash
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16      # stop with: brew services stop postgresql@16
createuser -s postgres; psql -d postgres -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"
createdb "template-db"
```

**Option 2 — throwaway instance (no service installed): lost on reboot**

```bash
initdb -D /tmp/spring-template-pg -A trust
pg_ctl -D /tmp/spring-template-pg -l /tmp/spring-template-pg.log start
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres' SUPERUSER;"
createdb "template-db" -U postgres
```

Check state anytime: `pg_isready -h localhost` (this is what `manage.sh` runs
before launching the backend).

## Schema: how it's managed

Flyway, applied automatically when the Spring API boots:

- Migration files live in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/` — one
  `V1__init.sql` holds the whole schema (users, profiles, the mail queue, 2FA).
  Flyway reads that location on every boot and records what it applied in a
  `flyway_schema_history` table — a second boot is a no-op, so there's no
  separate migrate step.
- `spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true` matters when Flyway points at a
  database an earlier migration runner already touched. That runner kept its own
  `schema_migrations` table; without a Flyway history Flyway would normally
  refuse to start. Baselining records a starting point instead, and since every
  migration is `IF NOT EXISTS`, either path is a no-op against an
  already-migrated database.
- Schema changes: add a `V2__*.sql` file. There is no list to keep in sync — the
  filename is the registration.
- Consolidating migration files (`V2__2fa.sql` folded into `V1__init.sql`) means
  a database that recorded the old pair has a history entry Flyway can't resolve
  locally, and validation fails with "applied migration not resolved". Reset the
  schema (`./manage.sh db:reset`, or the manual reset below) and let the
  consolidated file apply — dev and test databases hold nothing worth keeping.

Tables:

| Table           | Purpose                                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users`         | accounts: email, scrypt password, role, verify/reset tokens |
| `user_profiles` | one-time registration details (`ON DELETE CASCADE`)         |
| `email_queue`   | outbound mail (drained by the `@Scheduled` worker)          |
| `user_devices`  | trusted 2FA devices that skip the login code                |
| `login_codes`   | pending 2FA codes (expiry, attempts, resends)               |

Two rules apply to every query in
`backend/src/main/kotlin/com/htt/template/repository/`. `email_queue`'s column
is named `"to"`, a reserved word, so queries quote it. And the
`AS "camelCase"` aliases are load-bearing rather than decoration: rows map onto
the row data classes through their primary constructors, matched by parameter
name, so an alias that drifts from the property name fails at runtime on that
column rather than at compile time. The rest of the Kotlin-specific traps are
listed in [SPRING_MIGRATION.md](SPRING_MIGRATION.md).

Dev seed (`DevAdminSeeder`, only when `NODE_ENV=development`): upserts the dev
admin (README has the credentials) plus their profile, so it isn't blocked by
onboarding gates.

## Day-to-day operations

| Task               | Command                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status             | `pg_isready -h localhost` or `./manage.sh status`                                            |
| Reset **all** data | `./manage.sh db:reset` (drops and recreates the `public` schema)                             |
| Manual reset       | `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c 'DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;'`                |
| Re-seed            | `./manage.sh db:reseed` (drop schema, restart the backend so Flyway re-applies and re-seeds) |
| Look around        | `psql "template-db" -U postgres` → `\dt`, `\d users`                                         |
| Promote a user     | `./manage.sh role <email> <role>` (`java -jar build/libs/app.jar set-role`)                  |

`db:reset` asks for lowercase `yes` since `DROP SCHEMA public
CASCADE` destroys all data, including the Flyway history — the next boot
re-applies every migration. It reads the same `DATABASE_URL` chain described
above.

## Tests

The DB-backed integration tests need a reachable Postgres and are skipped
otherwise:

```bash
createdb "template-db-test"        # once
cd backend
TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/template-db-test?sslmode=disable" ./gradlew test
```

The test context points `app.database-url` at `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and boots
Flyway against it, so the schema is applied on the first run. Tests create
unique-email users per run and clean up after themselves, so they never reset
the database. `./manage.sh test` passes `TEST_DATABASE_URL` through when it's set
in your environment.

## Production

Any managed PostgreSQL (RDS, Cloud SQL, Neon, a Docker container) works: set
`DATABASE_URL` in the environment (`NODE_ENV=production` loads no `.env.dev`,
and only the backend's server environment matters — the frontend never touches
Postgres). Migrations apply on first boot against an empty database. Set a real
`JWT_SECRET` (`.env.example` has the minimum length).
